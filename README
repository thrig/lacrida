lacrida
=======

a Spring Lisp Game Jam 2020 game (use version 0.0.1 for that (no way
ready in time and subsequently fixed) code)

requires

 * a terminal with dimensions of at least 80x24; a font such as
   https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/ is recommended
 * SBCL (Clozure Common Lisp complains about the "BLACK_CLUB_SUIT" and
   other fancy characters used in structures.lisp; not sure how to make
   those portable)
 * the alexandria and cl-charms packages

assuming Quicklisp is installed and setup:

    cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
    git clone https://github.com/thrig/lacrida
    cd lacrida
    printf "\033[8;24;80t"
    ./run

 * there is minimal documentation; copy lacrida.6 into a suitable
   MANPATH directory (e.g. /usr/local/share/man/man6) and then run

    man 6 lacrida

 * keybindings are traditional to rogue(6) though can be fiddled with in
   definitions.lisp if need be
 * the ./compile script should produce a (very large) binary

sources

 * the initial commit code is from work done mostly back in June 2019
   that has a grid to move around in and not much more
 * shadowcast FOV code adapted from https://github.com/thrig/cl-fov
 * various terminal related code from https://github.com/thrig/cl-minterm
 * map generation is based on sin-map.lisp from
   https://github.com/thrig/ministry-of-silly-vaults
