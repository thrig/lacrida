lacrida
=======

a Spring Lisp Game Jam 2020 game (use version 0.0.1 for that (no way
ready in time and subsequently fixed) code)

requires

 * a terminal with dimensions of at least 80x24; a font such as
   https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/ is recommended
 * SBCL (or also Clozure Common Lisp run in a terminal)
 * the alexandria and cl-charms packages

installation on OpenBSD might run along the lines of:

    doas pkg_add sbcl gnupg
    ftp https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
    ftp https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp.asc
    gpg --recv-keys 028B5FF7
    gpg --verify quicklisp.lisp.asc
    sbcl --eval '(load "quicklisp.lisp")' \
         --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install)' \
         --eval '(quit)'

    cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
    git clone https://github.com/thrig/lacrida
    cd lacrida
    printf "\033[8;24;80t"
    ./run

 * there is minimal documentation; copy lacrida.6 into a suitable
   MANPATH directory (e.g. /usr/local/share/man/man6) and then run

    man 6 lacrida

 * keybindings are traditional to rogue(6) though can be fiddled with in
   definitions.lisp if need be
 * the ./compile script should produce a (very large) binary with SBCL

sources

 * the initial commit code is from work done mostly back in June 2019
   that has a grid to move around in and not much more
 * shadowcast FOV code adapted from https://github.com/thrig/cl-fov
 * various terminal related code from https://github.com/thrig/cl-minterm
 * map generation is based on sin-map.lisp from
   https://github.com/thrig/ministry-of-silly-vaults
