lacrida
=======

a Spring Lisp Game Jam 2020 game

requires

 * SBCL (this code is largely untested on other implementations though
   did load in Clozure Common Lisp at some point during development)
 * alexandria, cl-charms. assuming Quicklisp is installed:

    cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
    git checkout https://github.com/thrig/lacrida
    cd lacrida
    printf "\033[8;24;80t"
    ./run

 * there is minimal documentation; copy lacrida.6 into a suitable
   MANPATH directory (e.g. /usr/local/share/man/man6) and then run

    man 6 lacrida

 * keybindings are traditional to rogue(6) though can be fiddled with in
   definitions.lisp if need be

sources

 * the initial commit code is from work done mostly back in June 2019
   that has a grid to move around in and not much more
 * shadowcast FOV code adapted from https://github.com/thrig/cl-fov
 * various terminal related code from https://github.com/thrig/cl-minterm
